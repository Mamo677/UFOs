###Overview of Project
      Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis README.md.
#### Resources and Before Start Notes:
      Data Source: ufo_starterCode.js and index.html
     Data Tools: ECMAScript, JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB
     Software: ES6+, ECMAScript, MongoDB, Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0
     ####Overview of ES6+
     
         ECMAScript, also referred to as "ES," is a scripting language designed to help standardize JavaScript. This means that ES provides guidelines and rules for JavaScript to         follow, such as how a function should be created to run correctly, also known as the proper syntax.

     Because ES has provided standardization for JavaScript, it also brings updates to the language. There are updates to every major coding language that fix bugs, update code,        and provide overall quality of life improvements for the developers. ES6 is no exception!

     There have been many updates to ES over the years, though the sixth update was a major one. You'll probably see "ES6+" mentioned out in the wild pretty often; this is a           reference to the "big" update (ES6) as well as the later ones. It's also commonly known as "ES2015" or "ECMAScript 2015." (It was such an important update that it's even known       by its year!) There are quite a few
     
     
     ###JavaScript in the Real World
     JavaScript is one of the powerhouse languages out in the wild today. While its strength is in creating visually appealing and dynamic content, it is starting to grow into         other fields as well. Tensorflow, a popular machine learning tool, even has its own JavaScript library now.

    It's pretty easy to start feeling daunted by everything JavaScript can do, so Dana is more interested in examples of similar websites—ones that use filters on lots of data.

   Online shopping websites: These are a great example of dynamic content. They contain filters for departments, and then filters for items within those departments. Filters on       top of filters!
Ecological data: DThe National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) has very large and diverse datasets; these are also displayed on their website as dynamic tables with multiple filters.
Weather data: (The National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) also has very large datasets presented in table format on their website. These tables include filters and parameters that can be applied to their table.
